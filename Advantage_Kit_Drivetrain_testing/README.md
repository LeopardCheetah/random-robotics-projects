# Advantage Kit Testing (on a drivetrain)

---

We'll see what I end up doing -- for now it's simply trying to get some sort of logging (Epilogue/Advantge kit) working.    
Since I'm at home and don't have an actual robot, I think I'm gonna have to try this wpilib simulation thing to see if that'll work.   

01/02/2025 - Happy new year to all!

01/05/2025 - Added basic DT features. Simulated robot code (to some extent).
